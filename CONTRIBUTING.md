# Contributing to Kew

First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! ðŸŽ‰ 

Kew is a community project and every contribution helps make it better. Whether you're fixing a bug, adding a feature, or improving documentation, your help is welcome.

## Getting Started

1. Fork the repository
2. Clone your fork:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/justrach/kew.git
cd kew
```

3. Set up your development environment:
```bash
# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`

# Install development dependencies
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

4. Start Redis (required for running tests):
```bash
docker run -d -p 6379:6379 redis:alpine
```

## Development Workflow

1. Create a new branch for your changes:
```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
```

2. Make your changes

3. Run the test suite:
```bash
pytest tests/
```

4. Format your code:
```bash
black kew/
isort kew/
```

5. Run the linter:
```bash
flake8 kew/
```

## Testing

We use pytest for our test suite. All new features should include tests. To run tests:

```bash
# Run all tests
pytest

# Run specific test file
pytest tests/test_specific.py

# Run with coverage report
pytest --cov=kew tests/
```

### Test Requirements

- All tests must pass
- Coverage should not decrease
- New features must include tests
- Tests should include both success and error cases

## Code Style

We follow PEP 8 with some modifications:
- Line length: 88 characters (Black default)
- Use double quotes for strings
- Use explicit type hints where beneficial

We use these tools to maintain code quality:
- Black for code formatting
- isort for import sorting
- flake8 for linting

## Pull Request Process

1. Update the README.md with details of your changes if needed
2. Update the docs/ folder with any new documentation
3. Add or update tests as needed
4. Update the CHANGELOG.md following the Keep a Changelog format
5. Submit your pull request

### PR Requirements

- Clear description of changes
- Tests pass
- Code formatted with Black
- No linting errors
- Documentation updated if needed
- CHANGELOG.md updated

## Commit Messages

We follow the conventional commits specification. Each commit message should have a type:

```
